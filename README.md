### About Me
I’m an engineer with **4+ years of hands-on experience** building backend systems and **AI-driven architectures** with a strong focus on reliability, determinism, and real-world deployment.

In blockchain systems, I specialize in asynchronous transaction flows, wallet lifecycle management, gas estimation, nonce handling, and event driven state synchronization between on-chain smart contracts and off-chain backend services.

My work sits at the intersection of **AI systems, backend infrastructure, and distributed architectures**, where models, algorithms, and agents must operate inside production constraints.

- Designed an **AI Optimization System** inspired by genetic algorithms, implementing bit-level encoding, crossover, mutation, and fitness-driven evolution for deterministic learning.
- Built **agent-style workflows** where AI components interact with backend services, queues, and stateful systems.
- Built **AidChain**, a production-grade platform combining backend services, message queues, and blockchain infrastructure for transparent humanitarian aid distribution.
- Developed a **deterministic blockchain prototype in Go**, implementing block validation, Merkle trees, and consensus logic from first principles.

I focus on **engineering AI systems end-to-end** — from algorithms and agents to APIs, queues, and deployment.
